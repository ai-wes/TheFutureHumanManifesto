        # For QAEvalChain, `qa_pairs` are the "ground truth" from the document.

        # Let's assume generated_qa_list is [{"question": q, "answer": a_from_doc}]
        # We need to get "predicted" answers for these questions, ideally from an independent source
        # like a knowledge graph, or by asking the LLM to re-answer the question based on its general knowledge
        # or a provided context (which could be the scenario text itself, testing for self-consistency).

        # Option: Test self-consistency. Ask LLM to answer questions based *only* on the scenario text.
        # This is what QAEvalChain often does if you provide the same LLM.

        # Prepare for QAEvalChain:
        # It expects a list of dicts, where each dict has a question and a predicted answer.
        # The "ground truth" answers are implicitly the ones generated by QAGenerationChain.

        # Let's re-structure `generated_qa_list` if it's not in the right format for `evaluator.evaluate`.
        # QAEvalChain typically takes:
        # `inputs`: list of dicts, each with a "query" (question) and "answer" (ground truth from doc)
        # `predictions`: list of dicts, each with a "query" (same question) and "result" (LLM's predicted answer)

        # For self-consistency, we can treat the answers from QAGenerationChain as ground truth.
        # Then, we need to generate "predicted" answers.
        # The QAEvalChain itself can be used to generate these predictions if configured.
        # However, the provided snippet `self.evaluator.evaluate(qa_pairs, answers, ...)` suggests `answers` are pre-fetched.

        # Let's simplify: Assume QAEvalChain can take the QA pairs and evaluate them for internal consistency.
        # The `answers` argument in `_query_knowledge_graph` implies an external check.
        # If `_query_knowledge_graph` is not implemented, we rely on LLM's self-consistency.

        # Let's assume `generated_qa_list` is of the form: [{"question": str, "answer": str}]
        # And `_query_knowledge_graph` (if implemented) would return a list of dicts: [{"question": str, "result": str}]
        # For now, as `_query_knowledge_graph` is a pass, we'll simulate self-consistency.
