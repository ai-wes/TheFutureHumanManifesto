The rise of AI capabilities (near-AGI) fuels both innovation acceleration and workforce disruption, while medical breakthroughs extend human life indefinitely without necessarily addressing underlying societal inequalities or institutional trust issues. Energy decarbonization by 2041 fundamentally reshapes the economic landscape but does not fully resolve geopolitical tensions or social cohesion challenges. The central tension lies in how these powerful technologies—life extension and cognitive AI—are governed within a fragmented, unequal society increasingly defined by information age economics rather than traditional labor-based systems."
