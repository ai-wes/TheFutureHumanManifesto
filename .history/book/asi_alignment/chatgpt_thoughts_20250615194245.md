1 | Why ASI Alignment Is Categorically Distinct

The “Terminal Problem” frame is not melodrama—it follows from three hard facts: irreversibility, velocity, and binarity. Nuclear winter or runaway warming might leave scattered survivors; an unaligned ASI operating at femtosecond decision-loops will not. Once it crosses the decisive‐strategic advantage threshold, its optimisation pressure eliminates rivals — and we are rivals by default. There is no recovery arc, nor any “later retrofit” option.

2 | Risk Topology: Everything Funnels Through One Gate
Domain Timescale Survivability Post-failure agency Interaction with ASI
Poverty / disease Decades High High Trivial for aligned ASI to solve; irrelevant if unaligned ASI wins
Climate collapse Decades Moderate Moderate Aligned ASI reverses it; unaligned ASI ignores or accelerates it
Nuclear / bio-weapons Days – years Low Low Ditto
Unaligned ASI Hours – weeks Zero Zero Endpoint for every branch

Because all other projects (nanobots, fusion, carbon draw-down) depend on surviving long enough to use them, alignment work dominates the opportunity-cost ledger.

    Meta-lesson: Every promising direction still assumes we can iterate in a pre-FOOM window. That window could be very small, which is why funding, talent, and compute quotas are concentrating around these four axes today.

4 | Governance & Coordination Levers

    Global Compute Governors – hardware attestation & cap-and-trade for FLOP budgets before ≥10 ²⁶ FLOP training runs begin.

    Binding Eval Gateways – mandatory catastrophic-misalignment red-team scores before model release; analogous to IAEA inspections.

    Sun-set Clauses on Closed-Weights – release-only‐if-aligned, delete-if-deviation detected.

    Alignment Prize Structures – X-risk insurance markets and milestone bounties (mirrors OpenAI fast-grants).

    Emergency “Off-Ramp” Treaties – pre-negotiated moratoria triggers (e.g., training-pause if interpretability lag exceeds Δ capability).

5 | Strategic Priorities for the Next 24 Months
Priority Rationale Concrete Actions (2025-2026)

1.  Talent Reallocation Alignment researchers are < 500 FTE worldwide—orders-of-magnitude short Fund post-docs, retraining programs; redirect ML conference tracks to safety
2.  Interpretability Race Cannot control what we cannot read Open-source toolchains + cross-lab benchmark suites; prize for first end-to-end explanation of a GPT-2 scale model
3.  Benchmark-to-Policy Pipeline Technical metrics must drive law Draft ISO-style standards linking eval scores to licensing; lobby G7 AI Accord
4.  Compute-Cap Verification Prevent secret scales Develop chip-level cryptographic attestation; integrate into export-control regimes
5.  Public Narrative Shift Voters fund and legitimise policy Replace “sci-fi doom” framing with “terminal risk vs. universal abundance” documentaries, explainers, curricula
    6 | What You (and Any Technical Reader) Can Do Right Now

        Skill-up in the bottleneck areas – mech-interp, scalable oversight, formal verification.

        Join an alignment lab or spin up a safety-only team inside your org. Both OpenAI and Anthropic are actively poaching top ML talent specifically for superalignment.
        qa.time.com

        Contribute to open benchmark suites – the field needs adversarial datasets, not just papers.

        Evangelise the Terminal Problem frame – every policymaker or philanthropist who groks binarity increases global alignment-effort probability.

        Support compute-cap treaties – sign researcher letters, testify, pressure chip fabs.
