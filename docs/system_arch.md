GAPS 2.0: Streamlined Ingestion & Editorial, Robust Core (Non-Docker)

Core Philosophy: Maintain the advanced capabilities of the knowledge graph, probabilistic forecasting, scenario generation, and narrative synthesis. Simplify the real-time streaming backbone and the automation of the editorial/publishing workflow to reduce operational burden when not using containers.

Revised Architecture Focusing on Simplifying Layer 1 & 6:

Layer 1: Real-Time Data Ingestion & Event Processing (The "Senses") - SIMPLIFIED

    Purpose: Continuously gather, validate, and pre-process diverse data streams without the overhead of a full Kafka/Zookeeper setup.

    Components & Technologies:

        Data Sources: (Your list is excellent and remains) arXiv, PubMed, Google Patents, News APIs (NewsAPI, GDELT), financial market data, Metaculus/prediction market APIs, specialized forums (via scrapers), social media (Twitter/X API for sentiment).

        Ingestion Pipelines (Robust Python Scripts):

            aiohttp + feedparser (for RSS/Atom feeds).

            newspaper3k (for general article scraping).

            Custom API clients.

            Pydantic Models: For data validation (as per your original design).

        Simplified "Streaming" Backbone / Data Handoff:

            Option A: Redis Streams (Recommended for Simplicity + Decoupling)

                Setup: Install Redis (a single instance is much simpler to manage than Kafka).

                Process: Your individual Python ingestor scripts (one for arXiv, one for news, etc.) run periodically (e.g., via cron or APScheduler).

                Each script fetches data and then publishes it to a specific Redis Stream (e.g., stream:raw_arxiv, stream:raw_news).

                Advantages: Decouples ingestors from the KG loader. Provides persistence. Allows multiple consumers if needed later (though the KG loader will be the primary one). Supports basic consumer group concepts.

                Python Client: redis-py library.

            Option B: SQLite as a Staging Queue (Simpler, Less "Real-Time")

                Setup: Use a central SQLite database file.

                Process: Ingestor scripts write new items (e.g., paper URL, title, summary, source) into a pending_processing table in SQLite, marking them as "new".

                The KG loader script (Layer 2) periodically queries this table for "new" items.

                Advantages: Dead simple. No extra server processes to manage beyond Python and Neo4j.

                Disadvantages: More batch-like. Less suitable for very high-frequency updates. Concurrency needs careful handling if multiple ingestors write simultaneously (though SQLite handles this reasonably well at small scale).

        Stream Processing (Simplified):

            The initial NLP (entity extraction, topic tagging) can happen within the KG Loader script (Layer 2) after it pulls data from Redis Streams or SQLite. This avoids needing a separate stream processing framework like Quix Streams or Flink.

            If some pre-processing must happen before hitting the KG loader, the ingestor scripts themselves can do it before publishing to Redis/SQLite.

Layer 2: Dynamic Knowledge Graph & Feature Store (The "Brain") - REMAINS ROBUST
(Your description is perfect and stays as is)

    Components & Technologies:

        Graph Database: Neo4j (standalone installation).

            Node Labels & Relationship Types: As you defined.

        KG Loader: Python service/script.

            Change: Instead of consuming from a Kafka topic kg_updates, it will consume from the Redis Streams (e.g., stream:raw_arxiv, stream:raw_news) or poll the SQLite pending_processing table.

            It will perform the upsert logic into Neo4j. It can also perform the initial NLP (NER, topic tagging) if not done by ingestors.

        Feature Engineering: Cypher queries run periodically (e.g., via cron + a Python script that connects to Neo4j) or triggered after KG loader runs.

        Vector Store (for RAG): FAISS (managed as local files).

Layer 3: Probabilistic Forecasting Engine (The "Oracle") - REMAINS ROBUST
(Your description is perfect and stays as is)

    Components & Technologies:

        Forecasting Models: TFP STS (primary), advanced options like Pyro/NumPyro for BNs, ABMs (Mesa).

        Input Data: From Neo4j, external files.

        Model Training/Updating: Python scripts run periodically (e.g., cron, APScheduler) or manually. Forecast outputs (distributions, samples) saved to files (JSON, Parquet) or potentially nodes/relationships in Neo4j if structure allows.

        Execution: For simplicity, avoid a dedicated FastAPI service initially. Other layers can read the saved forecast files. If on-demand forecasting is critical for the dashboard, a simple Flask/FastAPI endpoint can be added later.

Layer 4: Scenario Generation & Simulation (The "Dream Weaver") - REMAINS ROBUST
(Your description is perfect and stays as is)

    Components & Technologies:

        Monte Carlo Simulation: Python scripts reading forecast outputs from files/Neo4j.

        Scenario Structuring & Consistency Logic.

        (Optional) WGAN-GP.

        Probability Assignment.

        Output: Scenarios saved as structured files (JSON) or in Neo4j.

Layer 5: Narrative Synthesis Engine (The "Bard") - REMAINS ROBUST
(Your description is perfect and stays as is)

    Components & Technologies:

        LLMs: API-based (OpenAI) or local (Ollama).

        Prompt Engineering.

        Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): LangChain, FAISS.

        Output: Markdown text.

        Execution: Python script called with scenario data (from files/Neo4j). A simple Flask/FastAPI endpoint can be added if the Streamlit dashboard needs to trigger new narrative generation interactively and frequently.

Layer 6: Editorial Workflow, Validation & Publishing Interface (The "Conductor") - SIMPLIFIED EXECUTION/AUTOMATION
(Your core components are good; we simplify the how-it-runs part)

    Purpose: Provide tools for author review, guidance, validation, and content export, with less emphasis on complex automated orchestration if not desired.

    Components & Technologies:

        Streamlit Dashboard:

            Core functionality remains: Visualize forecasts (reading from saved files/Neo4j), browse scenarios (from files/Neo4j), read narratives (from Markdown files).

            Interactivity:

                Could trigger Python scripts (e.g., scenario generation for a specific set of parameters, narrative generation for a selected scenario) using subprocess if those scripts are designed to be callable. This offers on-demand capabilities without full microservices.

        Validation:

            Manual Review: Primary method via Streamlit.

            Simple Backtesting Scripts: Python scripts run manually or via cron when you have historical data to compare against.

        Content Management & Export:

            Store generated scenarios (JSON) and narratives (Markdown) in a well-organized Git repository. This provides versioning and easy access.

            Pandoc: Use manually from the command line or via a simple Python script (subprocess.run(['pandoc', ...])) to convert final Markdown chapters.

        Orchestration (Simplified):

            cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows):

                Schedule periodic execution of Python scripts for:

                    Data ingestion (e.g., python src/ingest/arxiv_fetcher.py)

                    KG loading (e.g., python src/graph/kg_processor.py --source redis or --source sqlite)

                    Feature updates (e.g., python src/graph/feature_calculator.py)

                    Model retraining/updates (e.g., python src/forecasting/train_sts_model.py --milestone AGI)

                    Batch scenario generation (e.g., python src/scenarios/generate_batch.py)

            Python APScheduler: Can be embedded within a "master control" Python script if you prefer managing schedules in Python code. This script could orchestrate the sequence of other scripts.

            Manual Execution of Scripts: For many one-off tasks or when you want direct control (e.g., generating narratives for a specific scenario you just reviewed). A Makefile can be very helpful here to define common tasks (e.g., make ingest, make forecast_agi, make generate_narratives_chapter_3).
